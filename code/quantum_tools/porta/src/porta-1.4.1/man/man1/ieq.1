.SH FORMAT OF '.ieq' - FILES
.SH
The first line contains the dimension of the problem.
.nf

        DIM = n
.SH
In general, lines consisting of a capitalized keyword are significant 
for  input recognition. Such keywords can be
.nf

        COMMENT
        INEQUALITIES_SECTION
        END
.SH
and function specific keywords (such as ELIMINATION_ORDER).
There is no restriction concerning the order of sections.
.sp1
The keyword
.nf

        COMMENT
.SH
causes the programs to ignore the text until the next capitalized 
keyword occurs.
.sp1
The list of equalities resp. inequalities starts with the keyword
.nf

	INEQUALITIES_SECTION
.SH
Each  equation resp. inequalitiy  requires one line. Line numbers  
in  parantheses  are  optional. The values are rational and  have to
be given by numerator and (optional) denominator:
.nf

(ln) num1/den1 xind1 + num2/den2 xind2  .... <= (=>,==) 
numrhs/denrhs

e.g.: (2) -x2+3/4x5-3x7 >= 4/5
      2x2-  x3 = 8
.SH
The keyword
.nf

         END
.SH
is required to end the file.
.nf
